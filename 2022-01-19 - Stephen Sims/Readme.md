### Topic : Exploit Development Windows 10 /11
- Exploit manipulation security controls in the past had been scaled back. With each successive Windows release, newer controls are being gradually turned on.
	- The [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/emet-mitigations-guidelines-b529d543-2a81-7b5a-d529-84b30e1ecee0) was available for many years but had a very low adaption rate.
	- [Data Execution Prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention) has been available since Windows XP but was only turned on by default when Vista came out.
	- WIndows 10 came out with [Exploit Guard](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/10/23/windows-defender-exploit-guard-reduce-the-attack-surface-against-next-generation-malware/) with most mitigation on by default.
