# Readme



In my continuing journery is cybersecurity a security researcher known as [bsdbandit](https://twitter.com/bsdbandit) (Charles Shirer) starting showing up on my profile. I learned that he is  a Senior Security Consultant for Red Siege Information Security. I followed Red Siege on Discord and learned about the Wednesday Offensive, a short 30 minute mini web conference with no slides. 

The emphasis is on speaking naturally on various topics on Pentesting, Red Teaming and similar offensive operations. The guests are often high powered and experienced researchers coming from various sectors in Cybersecurity.

This year (2022) I decided to take notes as each guest present their topics and you are looking at that list.
