# Readme

In my cybersecurity journey a great Security Researcher known as bsdbandit (Charles Shirer) started showing up on my timeline during his time as a member of Red Siege Information Security.

 I followed Red Siege on Discord and learned about the Wednesday Offensive, a short 30 minute mini webinar with no slides. 

The emphasis is on speaking naturally on various topics on Pentesting, Red Teaming and other defensive operations. The guests are usually high powered and experienced researchers coming from various sectors in Cybersecurity.

This year (2022) I decided to take notes with each guest presenter.
So far this year ... :

### Note about these notes 
>These notes were created on obsidian. For best results clone and view within Obsidian. The irony does not escape me given Barrett Darnell stance on parsable notes.
