# Readme



In my cybersecurity journey a great Security Researcher known as [bsdbandit](https://twitter.com/bsdbandit) (Charles Shirer) started showing up on my timeline. I learned that he is  a Senior Security Consultant for Red Siege Information Security. I followed Red Siege on Discord and learned about the Wednesday Offensive, a short 30 minute mini webinar with no slides. 

The emphasis is on speaking naturally on various topics on Pentesting, Red Teaming and similar offensive operations. The guests are often high powered and experienced researchers coming from various sectors in Cybersecurity.

This year (2022) I decided to take notes with each guest presenter.
So far this year ... :

- [[2022-01-05 - Stephanie Snow Carruthers/Readme]]- Stephanie "Snow" Carruthers
- [[2022-01-12 - Barrett Darnell/Readme]]- Barrett Darnell

### Note about these notes 
>These notes were created in obsidian. For best results clone and view within Obsidian. The irony does not escape me given Barrett Darnell stance on parsable notes.
